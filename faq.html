	<h3> Where Can I buy Sushi? </h3>
	<p>You can choose one exchange from https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/sushi#markets, but, if you want to FARM SUSHI (and earn), your best option is to buy on Uniswap to avoid extra fees from transfers from other exchanges. 

Any DEX that swap using metamask/your wallet is a good option too. 

But you can buy in any exchange listed on Coingecko, then, transfer to you personal wallet to generate LP tokens. </p>

<h3> Where I can get SUSHI LP tokens to STAKE? </h3>
	<p>You get the "LP TOKENS" or "SUSHI ETH LP TOKENS" on Uniswap, to do so, first you need some amount of SUSHI and ETH.
Then, you go to https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x6b3595068778dd592e39a122f4f5a5cf09c90fe2 and click on Pool, then, click on Add Liquidity button, now, enter the amount that suit you needs, Uniswap will calculate the other amount automatically.
Now click in Supply.
Now you have LP tokens to stake and earn SUSHI (aka FARM SUSHI).</p>

<h3> How do I earn/farm SUSHI? </h3>
	<p>First you need to provide liquidity on Uniswap for any combination of asset that you have or buy SUSHI to get SUSHI ETH LP tokens (the highest reward possible).

After you provide liquidity, Uniswap give to you LP tokens, then, go to https://sushiswap.org/farms and choose one option in the menu that mach your LP tokens combination and click Select and then, in + (plus) button. 

Now, click in Max button and cut decimals to only 2 decimals only and click Confirm.

Tip: to avoid **Out of Gas** errors, edit your GWEI/GAS amount in metamask/wallet confirmation to: add 300000 as GAS LIMIT and put in GWEI the fast fee amount. You can check the best gas price in the site https://www.gasnow.org/, use the amount that suit you needs.
</p>

<h3> The SUSHI in "Pending harverst" is not showing in my wallet, how I tranfer them to my wallet? </h3>

<p>
You need to claim it. Go to Menu and choose in the menu the option that match you supplied LP tokens, then, click Harvest.

Tip: to avoid **Out of Gas** errors, edit your GWEI/GAS amount in metamask/wallet confirmation to: add 300000 as GAS LIMIT and put in GWEI the fast fee amount. You can check the best gas price in the site https://www.gasnow.org/, use the amount that suit you needs.
</p>

<h3>My transaction to provide/remove liquidity, stake/unstake is failing with "Out of Gas" error. </h3>
<p> 
You need to tweak the limit allowed for contract interaction. You can put 30000 in GAS LIMIT in metamask.
The contract is not going to use it all, only the necessary to execute all instructions. </p>


<h3> My SUSHI are in my Coinbase wallet and is taking hours to confirm </h3>

<p>The problem is in the Ethreum network that is overloaded, to avoid waiting so much, you need to tweak the GWEI and GAS LIMIT used. But, as related by somes users, Coinbase wallet don't allow you to change this.

One option is to transfer you SUSHI to your metamask wallet (or other wallet that allow tweaking GWEI and GAS LIMIT), then you can use fast fee and change gas limit to 300000 to avoid any out of gas error or waiting hours for transaction confirmation.


The earnings that you’ll receive from staking will be proportional to the amount of LP tokens you have staked versus the total amount of LP tokens staked. Unless you continue to provide liquidity, your holdings and corresponding reward earnings will gradually be diluted. </p>

<h3> Why would someone want to provide liquidity to SushiSwap, as opposed to Uniswap?. </h3>
<p>With SushiSwap, one can also provide some liquidity into a pool and earn rewards in the form of SUSHI tokens. However, unlike Uniswap, those SUSHI tokens will also entitle you to continue to earn a portion of the protocol’s fee, accumulated in SUSHI, even if you decide to no longer participate in the liquidity provision. As an early adopter to help provider liquidity, you become a significant stakeholder of the protocol.
